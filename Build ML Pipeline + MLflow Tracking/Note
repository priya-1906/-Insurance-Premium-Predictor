This module trains a pipeline (preprocessing + XGBoost) and logs a full run to MLflow, including:

✅ Preprocessing steps (numeric scaling + categorical encoding) so the pipeline can directly handle raw tabular data.

✅ Params of the XGBoost model (n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, etc.) for reproducibility.

✅ Metrics (RMSE, MAE, R², RMSLE) on a validation split to evaluate model quality.

✅ Trained Model logged as a complete scikit-learn pipeline (preprocessor + estimator), ready for inference.

✅ Submission CSV (insurance_predictions.csv) with predicted premium amounts for the test set.

✅ Local Artifacts saved into artifacts/ (pipeline.joblib + predictions) for use in deployment (e.g., Streamlit app).

✅ Experiment Tracking stored in mlruns/, so you can compare multiple runs and select the best model.

✅ Reproducibility: every run is versioned and reproducible using MLflow’s logging.

✅ Future Deployment Ready: the saved pipeline can be directly loaded in the Streamlit web app to serve predictions.
