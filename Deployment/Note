This module takes the trained ML pipeline (preprocessing + XGBoost model) and deploys it as an interactive Streamlit application.

What it does

Loads the trained pipeline (artifacts/pipeline.joblib) that was saved during model training.

Interactive UI where users can input customer and policy details (age, income, dependents, health score, etc.).

Auto-handles preprocessing: the pipeline applies the same scaling and encoding used during training.

Predict button instantly shows the estimated Insurance Premium Amount.

Expandable section displays the input data used for prediction.

Custom defaults (like Age = 35, Income = 30,000, Dependents = 2) to make testing easier.

Deployed via ngrok / localtunnel to share the app from Google Colab.
